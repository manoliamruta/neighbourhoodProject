Project Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a single page application featuring a map of Melbourne 
neighborhood, which I would like to visit sometime soon. It further 
displays places, third-party data about those places and 
supports a search among the listed places.

1.  Mainly referred the Google API documents and udacity videos. Have 
    used some portions of code from the github repository provided by 
    udacity.
2.  Utilized the API and documentation of Foursquare 
	https://developer.foursquare.com for collecting information about 
	locations in Melbourne.
3.  The examples and documentation of http://knockoutjs.com/ was very 
    helpful to implement observable variables/arrays and bind them to
    the DOM.
4.  Referred to few questions at StackOverflow for making the app 
    responsive.
